# Creating a Discord Bot Application
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Discord bot application. Discord bots are automated accounts that can perform various tasks in Discord servers. They can be used for moderation, utility, entertainment, and more.

- Prerequisites
Discord Account: You need a Discord account to create a bot application. If you don't have one, sign up at discord.com.

- Discord Server: You should have a server in which you want to invite your bot. If you don't have a server, you can create one by clicking the "+" button on the left sidebar in the Discord app.

Steps
1. Create a Bot Application
Go to the Discord Developer Portal.
Click on the "New Application" button.
Give your application a name. This can be the name of your bot.
Click on the "Create" button.
2. Add a Bot User
In your application's dashboard, navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left sidebar.
Click the "Add Bot" button.
A confirmation dialog will appear. Click "Yes, do it!".
3. Get the Bot Token
In the "Bot" tab, under the "TOKEN" section, click the "Copy" button to copy your bot's token. Keep this token secret!
4. Invite Your Bot to a Server
Still in the "Bot" tab, under the "TOKEN" section, you'll find a link labeled "OAuth2". Click it.
In the "Scopes" section, select "bot".
In the "Bot Permissions" section, select the permissions your bot needs. A common set includes "Read Messages", "Send Messages", and "Embed Links".
Copy the generated OAuth2 URL.
Open this URL in your browser and select the server where you want to invite the bot. Complete the authorization process.
